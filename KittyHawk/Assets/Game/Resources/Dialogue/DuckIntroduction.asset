  DialogueText:
  - Hey Kitty Hawk!
  - The farmer is out of town and the geese are rebelling.
  - Looks like you are going to be in charge for now.
  - Use the mouse or right stick to look around.
  - Use the WASD keys or left stick to move.
  - You can run with Shift or right trigger.
  - Jump with Space or A or X on controller.
  - That also works for interactions like this dialogue!
  - You can use left/right mouse button or X/B or Square/Circle to attack geese.
  - But be careful to time it right or they'll get you first!
  - Oh and if you see any catnip laying around, try to pick some up!
  - Collecting 10 catnip gives you an extra life.
  - Although being a cat and all, you can't have more than 9 lives.
  - Hey, looks like the chicks escaped the coop!
  - Can you herd them back in?
  - Good luck!
