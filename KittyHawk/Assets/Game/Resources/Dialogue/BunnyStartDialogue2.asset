  DialogueText:
  - Listen up Kitty - Beatrix Bunny needs your help!
  - Those geese are up to no good again. They've teamed up to snatch her little ones
    while she was out at the racetrack.
  - Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find each bunny and lead
    it back to its momma.
  - But the geese aren't just going to hand the bunnies to you. You can scare them
    off with a well-timed swipe of the paw or a bite attack.
  - Rumor has it the geese are holding their captives in this spooky old barn - the
    one that has a different layout every time you go in it!
  - Beatrix and The Farm are counting on you. We know you won't let us down Kitty
    Hawk. Now go!
