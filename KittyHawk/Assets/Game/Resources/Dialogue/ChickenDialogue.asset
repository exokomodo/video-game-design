  DialogueText:
  - Help Kitty! Our baby chicks have gotten out of their coops!
  - I'm worried that the Geese will scare them away, can you get them back in their
    coops?
  - We have 8 baby chicks in total, and I think some got locked in to the crops!
  - You might need to unlock the gate to help them
