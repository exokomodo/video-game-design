  DialogueText:
  - Congratulations! You did it Kitty Hawk!
  - You managed to get all the chicks back in the coop.
  - There's plenty more to do on the farm...
  - ...but you'll have to wait for the final release!
  - Until then, you could try riding the horse.
  - Or finding the key on the garage.
  - See you next time!
