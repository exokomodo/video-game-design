  - 'Thank you for rescuing Sonny, Cher, Chaz & Frank! '
  - We don't know who this 5th one is, but he seems happy to be here, so we'll keep
    him.
  - I was right about you Kitty, you really are the Chosen One who will restore peace
    and order yada yada yada to The Farm.
  - We owe you a debt of gratitude that we can never repay. We will never forget
    you Kitty Hawk.
  - Tomorrow, we'll turn the tables, and team up with Horse and take the fight directly
    to those pesky geese!
